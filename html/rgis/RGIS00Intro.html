Introduction

<blockquote>
RiverGIS is a component of the
GHAAS software package. RiverGIS serves as a data pre-processing and analysis
tool for geographic data.RiverGIS, as its name implies, is geographical
information system (GIS) software. RiverGIS is not intended to replace or
compete with existing GIS software. It was designed to complement existing GIS
packages (like ARC/INFO) and provide special functionality for river
hydrological studies. A key feature of RiverGIS is the capability to handle
grided networks in a topological manner. These river networks are derived from
digital elevation models (DEMs).<p> RiverGIS was developed for UNIX systems
(primarily for Linux and tested on SGI-IRIX and Digital-OSF/Unix, but is
likely to work on other flavors of UNIX). RiverGIS is configured to store all
loaded data in memory, thus processing speed will be influenced by file size.
